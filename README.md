# Hello world!
## A bit about this...
This is a simple HTML website that I published using Github Pages.
I always wanted to have a website of my own, but never had the commitment to constantly pay to website hosting.
I found the template of this website from https://cplmakerlab.github.io/simple-website-template/ where I forked their repository and tweaked it to suit my preferences.
Among the elements I personalized were background and font colors, photo placement, embedded other pages and links, and bio & icon creations.
For color choices, I was helped by this website that aims to increase website accesibility: https://webaim.org/. I particularly used their Contrast Checker for picking my font and background color.
I added alt text on every image on my website too as a way to increase accesibility.
Anyway, a few code prompts were provided by ChatGPT because I had little experience in coding.
You're free to fork this repository too. I always make sure that my creations are open access. :)
Happy coding!
